## Compiling JS / CSS assets
This library uses [Laravel Mix][link-mix]. See [webpack.mix.js][link-webpack-mix-file].

Install laravel mix via the command line:
``` 
$ npm install
```

Run all Mix tasks:
```
$ npm run dev
```

Run all Mix tasks and minify output:
```
$ npm run production
```
Watch assets for changes (keep running in terminal):
```
$ npm run watch
```

If Webpack isn't updating when your files change try:
```
$ npm run watch-poll
```
